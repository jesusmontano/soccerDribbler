# Angry Referee
## Background and Overview
Angry Referee is a single-player game. The objective of the game is to collect
the red cards while avoiding the players and the ball. Running into a defender 
or the ball will end the game. Collecting a mystery block may slow or speed up 
the opponents and ball. In order to win, the referee must collect all of the red
cards and not collide with the ball or any of the players.
